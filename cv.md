## *About Me:*
 Hey there! My name is Alex and I am a Junior Frontend Developer. For the time being,  I live in London and my work little have to do(nothing at all actually) with coding and building websites. And if you'd aske me a year ago: 
 \- "What do you know about frontend web development?";
 I'dd say:
 -"Not much...."" 
 ...weeeell, nothing at all, to be honest. But things change, time does not satnd still and people evolve. 
 So, long story short. I used to put peoples faces back together and was pretty good at doing it as a junior MaxFax. But then decided that it's not really my cup'o'tea, and that I always was drawn to...you guessed it!...developing applications.
